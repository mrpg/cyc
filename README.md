# cyc

`cyc` is a simple static site generator. `cyc` is orders of magnitudes faster and less bloated than its competitors.

As long as the documentation is lacking, I suggest the following: To learn how to use `cyc`, just clone this repository and run `make`. Use your browser to navigate to `public/index.html` and inspect the output pages generated as well as the source files in `content/` and `template/`. At some point, I will add more documentation.
