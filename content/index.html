<p>Welcome to the homepage.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoy my website.</p>

<p>By the way, here are my most recent blog posts:</p>

{{##blog/index.html.posts##}}

<p>The inclusion above is an autogenerated list of blog posts (see <tt>content/blog/mkblog.sh</tt>, which is invoked by <tt>make</tt>). When including files using <tt>{{&#35;&#35;filename&#35;&#35;}}</tt>, <tt>cyc</tt> looks for <tt>filename</tt> in</p>

<ol>
    <li>&hellip; the folder of the source file,</li>
    <li>&hellip; <tt>template/</tt>,</li>
    <li>&hellip; in the present working directory.</li>
</ol>

<p>The latter allows you include any file using absolute paths. For example, the hostname of the device that generated this page was <b>{{##/etc/hostname##}}</b>.</p>
